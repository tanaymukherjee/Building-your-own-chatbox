# Building-our-own-chatbox
We will use NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit) to develop our own simple chatbox that will respond based on user queries using a defined corpus.

Here we created a simple corpus and based on our response, the function identifies the relevant information from the in built corpus and returns the result.

The chatbot was named Kalam, in memory of one of World's finest scientist from India.

-- I am planning to make a more robust and detailed version of the same and it is a work in progress.

For now, we will use NTLK package. The work can be executed using Google Colab but you need to add the corpus file on your root folder of Gdrive.
